<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was raining dismally. Mabel, leaning
her arms on the broad window-sill,
watched the drops trickling down the
panes. Before her was an array of paper
dolls in gay tissue dresses. They sat
perched upon pasteboard chairs in front
of a circle of queer creatures with flat
heads, and no feet; hand in hand these
stood, rather flimsy in appearance.
Mabel had cut them all in one from a bit
of newspaper.</p>

<p>Presently she gave the whole company
a sweep off on the floor.</p>

<p>“I’m tired of you,” she said. “And
it’s raining, and I don’t know what to do.
I wish I were twins, so I could have someone
to play with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“Why, Mabel,” said her mother, “suppose
I had two discontented little Mabels
to be fretting around on a rainy day, what
should I do?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have to have two
Mabels,” returned the little girl, “you
could call one something else: Maude,
or—oh, mamma, you could call one May
and one Belle. I think I’d like to be
May, myself. That’s what I’ll do next
time I play by myself: I’ll pretend I
have a twin sister named Belle.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you pick up that company
of people, lying there by the window,
now, and play with your twin awhile.”</p>

<p>Mabel looked up mischievously. “I
think I’ll let Belle pick them up,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Well, let me see her do it. There is
a looking glass in which I can watch
her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Oh, like ‘Alice in the Looking Glass
Country’. You watch and see Belle pick
them up.” And she set to work, glancing
over her shoulder once in a while to
see if her mother took in the performance.
“There!” she said, after a time,
“Belle has picked them up, but we are
both tired of paper dolls. Mamma, there
is a red flag hanging out by a door across
the street; in that house where the little
boy lives. What is it for? Do you suppose
he has scarlet fever?”</p>

<p>Her mother laughed. “No, there is
an auction—a sale going on.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know, dear. For some
reason they are selling off their household
goods and furniture.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder if the little boy likes to
do that. Who is selling the things—his
papa?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“No, an auctioneer.”</p>

<p>“Does he say, ‘Going, going, gone,’ like
Uncle Lewis does when he pretends to
sell me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Can anybody go to a—a nauction?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. How many questions a
little girl can ask.”</p>

<p>“Well, mamma, I think if you’ll ’scuse
me, I’ll go down stairs and find something
else to do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll excuse you, certainly. Don’t get
into mischief.”</p>

<p>But Mabel was out of the door and on
her way down the steps by this time. She
stopped at the parlor, peeped in, and then
went over to the piano which she opened
and began to drum softly upon it, but she
knew her mamma did not allow this, so
she went across the hall to the library.
This was a favorite room, especially on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
rainy day, and, when her father was not
busy there, Mabel was often allowed to
curl herself up in one of the big chairs
with a book. To-day, however, she did
not feel inclined to settle down and looked
around to find something to invite her
attention. A box of water-colors stood
open upon the desk where her father had
been working. He had been coloring
some drawings to use in his class at the
university.</p>

<p>Mabel stood gazing at the colors longingly;
they did look so bright and pretty.
She took up one of the brushes and wet
it in the glass of water her father had been
using; then she dipped it in the brightest
vermillion in the box.</p>

<p>“I wish I had something to paint,”
she said to herself. Looking through a
pile of newspapers, she found nothing
that would do, and her eyes next sought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the books nearest her. She opened one;
it was fresh and new. “Oh, I couldn’t
take that,” she said. “But this old one,
I don’t believe he cares much for this. It
has pictures in it, but they are very queer,
and so yellow, I’m sure the book isn’t of
any account at all. I think it would look
much better if I were to paint it up a little.”
And, the action being suited to the
word, the brush was soon making dabs
at the colors on the box, and the figures
in the engravings were given startling
costumes of red, or blue, or yellow, as
Mabel’s fancy dictated.</p>

<p>She could not help feeling a little
guilty, though all the time telling herself
that it was a worthless old book,
and that her mamma often gave her
old magazines to try her own paints
upon.</p>

<p>Yet, when she heard a step on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
stairs, she started guiltily, and shut the
book with a snap, then put down her
brush, unaware that she had upset the
glass of water in her haste, and that it
was running across the table and soaking
through the book.</p>

<p>She hurried out of the door leading to
the porch. Here she could listen to the
voice of the auctioneer, as it came to her
ears quite distinctly from across the
street. It had stopped raining, though
little puddles still lay among the bricks
of the walk.</p>

<p>“Any one can go,” thought Mabel;
“mamma said so. I should love to see
a nauction. And that little boy, I
wonder if he is there.”</p>

<p>It was mild spring weather, and Mabel
thought she could dispense with a hat.
She would rather not go in the house
again just then; “I’ll go to the nauction,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
she said. “It’s no more than going to a
store; mamma said so.”</p>

<p>So, running across the street, she stood
for a moment before the gate of the little
boy’s home, then slipped in; another
moment found her in a room full of people.
She turned to run away, as several
turned to look at her, but she caught
sight of the forlorn figure of a little boy
huddled up in one corner, hugging a
large dog, and towards these two she
made her way.</p>

<p>The little boy looked up with a faint
smile as Mabel approached, then made
room for her on the box on which he was
sitting.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it funny?” whispered Mabel,
while the auctioneer went on rapidly:
“A dollar an’ a half an’ a half.”</p>

<p>But the little boy didn’t look as if he
thought it very funny, for he turned his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
head away, and Mabel thought she saw
two tears rolling down his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Is your father here?” she asked.</p>

<p>The little fellow shook his head, and
just then, the articles in that room being
disposed of, the crowd went into the next,
and the two children were left alone.</p>

<p>“Are you going to move?” asked
Mabel. “I live across the street, you
know, and I saw the red flag hanging
out, so I just came over.”</p>

<p>The boy nodded.</p>

<p>“I’m Mabel Ford. My sister told me
your name; it’s Harold, isn’t it? What
a dear dog that is. What’s his name?”
Mabel was not to be daunted by Harold’s
silence.</p>

<p>“Don.” This time he answered her.</p>

<p>“I wish you were not going away. Do
you want to?” Mabel’s questions continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“No,” returned Harold, “but you know
father has to go with his regiment to
Cuba, and so I have to go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you going to Cuba? What
will you do when they are fighting?
When are you going?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know when I am going, but I
am not going to Cuba.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should think you would be glad
not to. Will they take all the things
out of the house?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so. I expected to go
to my aunt’s to-day, but Drake hasn’t
heard from her; neither have I.”</p>

<p>“And your papa went and left you all
alone?”</p>

<p>“He had to, for he had to join his
troops, and he thought my aunt would
be here before this.”</p>

<p>Mabel thought this a dreadful state of
affairs, and looked her sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“You see,” Harold went on, “these
aren’t our things; not many of them.
Father rented the house furnished, and
only brought a few of our own things
here.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” That was better, Mabel
thought, but her curiosity was still unsatisfied.
“Where shall you go to-night?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll go home with Drake, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“The coachman. Well, not the coachman,
exactly. He does all sorts of
things, and his wife has kept house for
us all winter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; but I should think it would
be much nicer with your aunt.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will be when I can go to
her, but I can’t yet. You see, she is
probably away from home, and if I started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
without knowing all about it, I might
get to her house and find no one there,
and then what should I do in a strange
place?” Harold was fast growing more
communicative.</p>

<p>“That would be dreadful,” agreed his
companion, overcome by his lonely condition.
“I tell you what I wish you’d
do,” she hastened to say: “I wish you’d
come over with me. We haven’t any
boys at our house, and I’ve always
wanted awfully to be a boy. You see it
would be fine if I were, for now I’m just
nothing. Alice is the oldest, so she’s
some importance, and Louie is the baby,
so she’s the pet, and I’m in the middle
where I can’t be anything, and I
don’t have anyone to play with, for
Alice is fourteen and Louis is only
two.”</p>

<p>“Your mother wouldn’t want me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
maybe,” said Harold, though his eyes
looked wistful.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes she would,” returned Mabel,
confidently; “I’m sure she would. She
lets me have my school friends come, and
sometimes they stay all night.”</p>

<p>“But I’m a boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind, we can’t help that.
You can pretend you are a girl, if you
want to, and I’ll lend you one of my
frocks.”</p>

<p>This brought the first approach to a
laugh which Harold had shown, and he
consented to go and hunt up Drake, and
Mabel went with him.</p>

<p>Drake, himself, was not to be found,
but his wife was, and to her Mabel made
known her request.</p>

<p>“Well, I just wish he would go,”
declared Mrs. Drake. “He’s been moping
around ever since his father went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
away, and we two old people can’t cheer
him up like you could. Go along, Harold,
if you like, and stay as long as you
want to.”</p>

<p>So Harold followed his new friend
across the street, and when the situation
was explained, true enough, he was given
a warm welcome by Mrs. Ford. An hour
later the two children, with little Louie,
were playing in the laundry, having
great times, with a tub of water and some
very primitive fishing lines.</p>

<p>“I don’t usually like babies tagging
after me,” Mabel confided to her friend,
fearing he might think her less like a
boy than she had given him reason to
suppose, “but Louie’s nurse has gone
out,” she explained.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind her. I think she
is a dear little girl,” Harold returned,
and Mabel was relieved when his heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
seemed entirely won by Louie’s overtures
to “Boy,” as she called him.</p>

<p>All went merrily enough till supper
time; then Mabel, intent only upon making
Harold at home, brought him smilingly
into the dining-room. She had forgotten
the affair of the book, but it came
back to her in a very unpleasant manner,
when her father, with one of his
most severe looks, greeted her with:
“Mabel, was it you who was in the library
this afternoon, meddling with my box of
colors?”</p>

<p>Mabel turned as red as a beet, hung
her head, tried to speak, and at last, faltered
out: “I—I—yes, papa.”</p>

<p>“I might have expected it from a baby
like Louie, but a girl as big as you must
certainly have known better. You have
ruined one of my most valuable and rare
books,” Mr. Ford went on to say. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
this before Harold. Poor Mabel felt as
though she would sink through the floor.
She wondered what punishment would be
meted out to her, and she looked with
pleading eyes at her mother.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">“THIS is Harold Evans,” Mrs. Ford
said, tactfully drawing her husband’s
attention from Mabel. “Harold’s
father is in the army, and has gone to
Cuba, so we are trying to make our little
neighbor feel less lonely.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Evans? oh, yes,” said Mr. Ford,
looking up; “I know him. That’s right,
Alice, make the boy feel at home. Come
here, son, and sit by me.” And the
cloud blew over, much to Mabel’s relief.
But the hurt of her remorse and shame
still lingered. She did like to appear
well before her friends, and to be shown up
as a naughty, meddlesome little girl, was
very hard. Besides, she really was
greatly distressed at having spoiled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
book, for she knew how her father loved
his library, and treasured his rare books
and papers.</p>

<p>“Papa,” she faltered, “I’m dreadfully
sorry. I thought it was just an old book
you didn’t care for; and—yes, I knew it
wasn’t right to touch it. Is it one of
your very preciousest books?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied her father; “I am
afraid it is. See, Mabel; not only is this
old print marred by those dreadful glaring
colors, but you upset the glass of
water I left here, and it has soaked
through the book and carried the stain of
the fresh paint with it. Then, where you
were painting the pages are stuck together;
and, well, you can see that
destruction has followed your meddling.
I must forbid you coming into this room
again until your mother or I have given
you permission.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“Oh!” Mabel stood the picture of distress.
“I am so sorry, papa,” she repeated.
“I’ll never do so again. What
can I do to myself?”</p>

<p>A little smile flickered around her father’s
mouth. “I’m afraid nothing you could
do would restore my book. Another copy
would be almost impossible to find.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get this one?”</p>

<p>“I came across it at an auction. It
was in a lot of books which were lumped
together, and went very cheap.”</p>

<p>“Was it an auction like that at Harold’s
house this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How much is very cheap?”</p>

<p>“Oh, five dollars for the lot, I think I
paid.”</p>

<p>Mabel was very thoughtful for a few
moments. Several plans were at work
in her mind. Finally, seeing that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
father wanted to return to his work, she
said: “I came to tell you how sorry I
am, papa, and to say good-night. I think
maybe, if you don’t kiss me I’d feel
worse.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to feel worse?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to, but I suppose it
would do me good, and make me remember.”</p>

<p>“Well, my small philosopher, you
completely disarm me. I confess I was
very angry at first, and still feel annoyed,
but if I can help your memory by withholding
my usual good-night kiss, go to
bed without it. Good-night, daughter.”</p>

<p>Mabel lingered wistfully. It was very
hard to make her up mind to go without that
good-night kiss, and her lips quivered as
she turned away, seeing that her father
meant to follow out her suggestion. But
on the spot she formed a resolution to try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
to replace the book if ever she could.
Five dollars! that was a lot of money;
more than she ever had at once, but she
would save up every penny. She wondered
if there were any books sold at
Harold’s house that afternoon. She
would ask him.</p>

<p>The next morning, while the family
were at breakfast, Drake appeared with
rather a perturbed countenance. “I’d
like your advice, Mr. Ford,” he began,
“So long as your lady was so good as to
invite little Harold to come over here, sir,
I thought, perhaps you wouldn’t mind
helping me out in getting him fixed. You
see, sir, when the Captain went away he
said the boy was to go to his aunt, and
that I was to take him as soon as I heard
from her. Now she writes, or rather a
nurse does, and says she’s laid up to a
hospital, sannytorum, they call it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
it’ll be weeks before she’s out again, and
will I look after the boy till she’s well.
She seems to think I’m some sort of kin-folks
to him. But you see, sir, me
and my wife has a chance to go to the
country to a good place, and how’ll
we take the boys, we being hired help
like?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Mr. Ford glanced up at
his wife.</p>

<p>Mabel slipped down from her chair and
went close to her mother.</p>

<p>“Mamma, let him come here,” she
whispered. “He hasn’t any mamma nor
any sisters and brothers, nor anything.
I’ll give up my room if Alice will let me
sleep with her.”</p>

<p>“Mabel proposes that we invite Harold
here,” said Mrs. Ford. “She will give
up her room to him, Phillip.”</p>

<p>“Well, but how about you? It is something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
of a charge to take a boy into the
family where there are only girls.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the charge willingly.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ford nodded with a satisfied air.
“It’s settled then, Drake. We’ll take care
of the lad. Captain Evans and I are
acquaintances, and I do not think he
would object to the arrangement.”</p>

<p>“He’d be that thankful, sir,” said the
old man feelingly, but he looked at
Mabel, who at once understood.</p>

<p>“There’s the dear doggie, too. Do you
mind him, mamma? He is such a darling,
and Harold loves him so.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have the whole combination,”
laughed Mr. Ford, who loved animals.
“He’s a collie, isn’t he? I’ve seen him
on the street and he seemed a fine
fellow.”</p>

<p>And so it was settled that Harold
and Don should enter the family for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
time being, and Mabel proceeded, forthwith,
to lay her plans and to get her room
ready for this newcomer. She took her
dolls, her specially girly books, and certain
little knicknacks into her sister’s
room.</p>

<p>“What do boys like in their rooms?”
she asked Alice.</p>

<p>“Oh, all sorts of funny things. Bows
and arrows, and guns, and swords, and
oars and fishing tackle and such things.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mabel opened her eyes at the
idea of such queer taste, and she went
out of the room wondering how she
could supply these things.</p>

<p>Then she remembered that there was
in the garret a hammock, which had
fallen into disuse; it was something like
a net, she reflected, and she dragged it
forth. After many efforts, and finally
resorting to a chair placed on top of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
table, she managed to climb up high
enough to drape the hammock in some
sort of fashion over the door, viewing the
result of her labors with much satisfaction.
But she thought the room needed
some further decoration, and she returned
to the garret. After fumbling around,
she discovered a pair of old boxing
gloves, and a pair of foils, and at last
found leaning against the wall, a dust-covered
picture representing a hunting
scene.</p>

<p>“There!” she exclaimed, “that is exactly
what I want. I wonder if papa will
let me have these.”</p>

<p>Down stairs she trudged again, and
reported to her sister, who good-naturedly
went to the library, since Mabel was forbidden
there, and came back with her
father’s consent to use the things for
decoration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Mabel was repaid for all her work when
Harold, upon being ushered into the
room, exclaimed: “Why this doesn’t look
like a girl’s room. See those foils
and those boxing gloves. It looks like
some of the officer’s rooms. This is great!”</p>

<p>“And where is Don going to sleep?”
asked Alice.</p>

<p>Harold’s countenance fell. “He always
sleeps at the foot of my bed,” he replied,
fondling his dog, who looked up wistfully,
not understanding all these changes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford looked a little dubious.</p>

<p>“He’s very good and quiet,” said Harold,
eagerly. “He never makes any noise
or gives a bit of trouble. He minds every
word I say to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will let him try it for a
night;” agreed Mrs. Ford, “and if he
behaves well there is no reason why he
shouldn’t do as he has been in the habit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
of doing.” And Harold’s heart was completely
won.</p>

<p>Indeed, a few days after this, Don
proved himself entirely worthy of the
confidence placed in him; for Mrs. Ford,
hearing Alice cry out: “Oh, mother,
come quick!” ran to the nursery, where
she found her eldest daughter sitting on
the floor, one arm around little Louie,
and the other around Don, while she
alternately kissed Louie’s golden head
and Don’s black one, murmuring in an
agitated voice: “Oh, dear little sister!
Oh, Don! oh, Don!”</p>

<p>“Why, Alice, what in the world is
the matter?” exclaimed Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, mother, that blessed dog
has saved our darling baby’s life,” said
Alice, looking up with tears in her eyes.
“Maria left Louie just for a moment,
while she went down to get her milk, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
asked me if I would watch her till she
came back, and when I had come in she
had climbed up to the window.” There was
a catch in Alice’s voice and she hugged
the little one closer, then she went on:
“Louie had climbed up to the window,
and was hanging half way out with Don
holding tight to her dress with his teeth.
But for him, she must fallen out and
have been killed. Oh, good, brave doggie!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford caught up her baby girl,
and hers were not the only tears that fell
on Don’s head.</p>

<p>So, from that time forth, the good dog’s
place was sure, and he was allowed access
to any room in the house, many a time
finding his way into the library, where
Mr. Ford permitted him to remain, without
so much as a word of protest.</p>

<p>All this, of course, made Harold very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
happy and he soon felt so much at home
that he really dreaded the time when he
should have to go to his aunt. Meanwhile,
he and Mabel became the best of friends,
for, as Mabel said, she liked boy’s play better
than girl’s, and a bag of marbles, a top,
or a ball, took her fancy much more than
a doll, and the games the two children
had in the garden were something beyond
imagination, so exciting were they.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s such fun to have a boy to
play with,” Mabel would say. And the
highest compliment she could receive
from Harold, was: “You did that as well
as any boy, Mabel.”</p>

<p>To be sure, it was hard, on rainy days,
that Harold should be allowed the freedom
of the library from which she was
still barred; but Harold was very good
about this, and delicately refrained from
spending much time among the fascinating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
books, even though he liked nothing
better than to curl up in one of the big
chairs, and pore over some old chronicles
of war or history.</p>

<p>Mabel was very grateful to him for his
consideration, although, once in a while,
she did desert him for her school friends,
Marie Lewis and Ethel Morris, for there
was quite enough girl about Mabel for
her to enjoy certain plays which Harold
didn’t endorse because they were too
tame. But for all this new element
which furnished her with a playmate at
home there was some trouble ahead for
Mabel, all on account of that unfortunate
book.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE were still some weeks before
the summer holidays, and Mabel,
in consequence, was at school during the
morning, and the day after Harold was
happily established at her home she
started merrily off to school, looking forward
to a happy afternoon.</p>

<p>At recess, Marie Lewis and Ethel
Morris called her. “Oh, Mabel, we’ve
the loveliest idea, and you will just love
it. Come over here and let’s talk about
it.” So, with lunch-baskets in hand,
they settled themselves in a quiet corner.</p>

<p>“We want to give a lawn party for the
benefit of the Cuban orphans,” began
Marie, “and we’ll have some little things
to sell, and oh, Mabel, you told me the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
other day, that you had two dollars;
you’ll give that towards it, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Mabel flushed up to the roots of her
hair. “I don’t know,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t that mean?” cried Ethel.
“You said you knew she’d give it,
Marie.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she has to ask her mother,”
said Marie, trying to help Mabel out of
her difficulty.</p>

<p>“No, I——but I’m saving up for something
else,” said Mabel, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, but nothing could be better than
this. Of course it’s nice to give to missions
and—all sorts of things, but you
know we don’t often have a war, or anything
like this, and it’s immejet,” announced
Marie with some importance.</p>

<p>Mabel looked distressed. “I think,
maybe, mamma can tell me about what
I’d better do,” she said at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Well, just tell me this:” Ethel said;
“Is it for any charity thing that you
want to save the money?”</p>

<p>Mabel shook her head.</p>

<p>“Then I think you’re real mean,”
declared Ethel, with a toss of her head
as she flounced away. “Let’s go and
get someone else to join us, Marie. We
thought you’d be glad that we picked
you out the first one, Miss Mabel, but we
don’t want anyone who grudges those
poor orphans.”</p>

<p>Mabel watched them depart whispering,
and looking back at her contemptuously,
and felt very much inclined to
cry, but just then the bell rang for
school, and she went to her seat, feeling
bitterly all the afternoon, because of the
little scornful flouts and tosses of the
head which Ethel gave every time she
looked her way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Harold, with Don at his side, was waiting
on the steps for her as she came
slowly up the street. He seemed so
very friendly that Mabel thought that
she would pour out her grievances to
him.</p>

<p>“Well, but what are you saving up
for?” he said, after hearing her story.</p>

<p>“Why,” she hesitated, “tell me,
Harold, if you break or spoil anything
belonging to another person don’t you
know you ought to try and get another?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; I suppose it isn’t just
straight not to. I know my father always
says that it isn’t honorable not to pay
debts, and that is a sort of a debt. He
made me save up and pay for a window
I broke once, ’cause it was my fault. I
was shying stones when I was told
not to.”</p>

<p>Mabel nodded emphatically. “That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
what I thought. You see, you know
about the book.” She spoke shyly; it
was a sore subject.</p>

<p>“What book?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know, last night at
supper when papa said that to me?”</p>

<p>“Why, I believe he did speak up sort
of sharply, but I didn’t pay much attention;
I was so hungry, and those hot
biscuits looked so good.”</p>

<p>Mabel gave a sigh of relief. Her
shame was lessened, but she went on
with her confession: “Well, you see, I
spoiled one of papa’s most choicest books;
I—I—knew better, too; I daubed it all
up with papa’s paints, and he feels, oh,
awfully, and I’m going to try to get
another book like it. It is very, very
old.” She opened her little purse, and
unfolded a paper on which she had copied
every word of the title page of the book.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
“Were there any books sold at your
house the other day?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then this might have been among
them. I wish I had thought.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it was. I know pretty
well about the books that were sold. Still,
it might have been.”</p>

<p>“Papa got his at a nauction,” Mabel
went on; “he paid five dollars for a lot
of books, and that is what I must try
to do.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you wouldn’t have to do that.
You might find it at that second-hand
book store on Ninth street.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that. I wonder if
mamma will let us go down there this
afternoon? I’ll ask her.”</p>

<p>Consent having been obtained, the two
started forth, but only disappointment
met them. “You’ll find it hard to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
hold of that book,” the man in the store
told them, smiling and looking at them
curiously, as if he wondered what in the
world they could want of such a thing.
“Won’t some other book do?” he asked.</p>

<p>Mabel shook her head, but went away
convinced that she must keep on trying,
and that she had no right to put her
money to any other use until she was
satisfied that it was impossible to get the
book.</p>

<p>She and Harold considered this their
secret, and talked a good deal about it,
so that Mabel had this comfort, while at
school her two friends openly scorned
her.</p>

<p>“Of course, we’ll invite her,” Marie
was heard to say one day, “but I don’t
suppose she’ll come; she’s too mean to
spend ten cents to get in.”</p>

<p>A burning blush suffused Mabel’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
cheeks, and she bent her head over her
desk, feeling very much mortified, but
she did not make an effort to change the
girls’ opinion of her.</p>

<p>“I think girls are a mean lot,” Harold
said, indignantly, when he was told of
this. “I’d trust a fellow more than that.
I’d know what he was going to do with
his money, or whether he was going to
spend it in some selfish way, before I
talked that way.”</p>

<p>“Maybe a boy would,” returned Mabel.
“Anyhow, Harold, it’s a great comfort
to have you here, or else I might give up,
and take the money to the girls, after
all. Mamma said I must do just what
seemed to me right.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you give it to them,” said
Harold, fiercely. “You just hold out,
no matter what they say. I’ll take you
to the lawn party.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Oh, Harold!” Mabel was deeply grateful
for this offer. “I think it’s lovely for
you to say that, but I don’t believe I shall
want to do that. I’ll just wait till I’ve
got the book, and then I’ll save up and
send my money to the orphans. Mamma
will do it for me. She can send it straight
to the ladies who take care of the money
and see that the orphans get some of it.”</p>

<p>Harold looked at her admiringly.
“That’s fine,” he said; “I don’t believe
I’d be as modest as that. I’d like to show
off before those girls, and just flourish
around at the lawn party, if I had money
to spend.”</p>

<p>“I should, too,” returned Mabel, “but,
somehow, I don’t think I ought to, after
what I did to the book.”</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” said Harold, “the
thing we ought really to do, is to hunt up
red flags, and auctions, and go for them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
whenever we can; there’s no telling what
we might find.”</p>

<p>To this Mabel agreed, but the chances
were few and far between, and they began
to think theirs an impossible quest.</p>

<p>One day, to be sure it was after Mabel
had saved up a full five dollars by dint
of all sorts of sacrifices and helpings, the
two entered a house where a sale was
going on, chief among the articles to be
sold being a choice library. There was a
catalogue of the books, and over this the
children pored, till Harold exultantly
exclaimed, “There it is Mabel!” And
sure enough, the title was printed in full.
They waited nervously till the bidding
began. Certain books were sold singly;
the rest in lots; among the first was the
one on which Mabel had set her heart.
When it was put up for sale, the first offer
was two dollars, and Harold, with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
heart in his mouth, cried: “Three!”
“Four!” came from another corner of
the room. “Five!” said Harold, with a
quick glance at Mabel, who with very red
cheeks, and parted lips, stood by his side.
“Six!” the word came that shattered
their hopes, and then the book was run
up to fifteen dollars, the buyer passing
quite near to the children, exclaiming to
a friend: “It’s a bargain, Nevins; I
wouldn’t take fifty dollars for it.”</p>

<p>Fifty dollars! So it was a hopeless matter
after all. No wonder her father had
been so displeased at the destruction of
his property, thought Mabel. The two
small figures left the place almost immediately.</p>

<p>“It’s no use trying,” began Mabel;
“I’m just going to give up. I never in
the world could save up all that money;
fifteen dollars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“I have five,” replied Harold; “I can
lend you that much.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” Mabel refused utterly; “I
haven’t any way of paying it back, and
papa says to borrow money when you’ve
no way of paying it is almost the same as
stealing.”</p>

<p>“But you could save up and pay it
some day; of course, you could.”</p>

<p>“No, I might never be able to; besides,
it might be years and years and it
wouldn’t be right to keep you out of the
money all of that time when you might
want it. Oh, dear, I wish I never had
been so careless.”</p>

<p>Harold tried to cheer her by reminding
her that her father had bought his
book for five dollars, and why shouldn’t
she come across another such bargain,
and he said they must not give up the
hunt for the book. “I’ll look in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
papers every day,” he said with quite the
air of a man, “and whenever we can we
will go to a auction.”</p>

<p>“I thought it was a ‘nauction,’” said
Mabel.</p>

<p>“No, it’s ‘auction.’”</p>

<p>Mabel looked a little doubtful and
Harold hunted up a newspaper, and, after
some searching, triumphantly pointed
out the word to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” admitted Mabel; “I’ll
say, auction, then. Somehow, though,
this one, that we went to to-day, scared
me; there were so many people there,
and they made such a noise.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t mind people; I don’t.
I’ll always go with you, and take care of
you, you know.”</p>

<p>“There aren’t many things you are
afraid of, are there?”</p>

<p>“Why, not many. You see, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
father is a soldier, and I have to be
brave.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” this explained the situation
fully to Mabel, and they returned to the
subject of the auction.</p>

<p>“Next time,” said Harold, “I’ll do all
the bidding, and you need not come into
the room, if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I do want to; it’s sort of
exciting, although I do get tired of hearing
the auctioneer; but as long as it is
the only way of getting the book, why,
of course, we must go to every auction we
hear of.”</p>

<p>Therefore, a few days later they made
their plans again, hopefully, to go to a
house in Germantown, where Harold had
discovered that an auction was to be held
that day.</p>

<p>“Where are you two children off
to, now?” Mrs. Ford asked. “Is it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the Zoo this time, or Rittenhouse
Square?”</p>

<p>“No, mamma,” Mabel replied, “do you
mind if we go to Germantown?”</p>

<p>“To Germantown? Why, that is a long
trip for two small bodies. Are you sure
you won’t get lost?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure, mamma; Harold knows
just how to go.”</p>

<p>These secret expeditions and their
object were known to Mrs. Ford, and she
usually permitted them when she felt
sure they were safe; so, in this case,
after some questioning, she gave her consent,
and the two set forth.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER leaving the car, the way for
Harold and Mabel led through a
quiet, shady street, where old houses
stood each side the road, and the children
were rather inclined to think it a more
pleasant place than where they lived.</p>

<p>“The reason I like it,” said Harold,
“is because there was a battle fought
here; my father told me all about it, and
he showed me the house where the fight
was the hardest, and there are bullets
buried in the walls; it is called the old
Chew house.”</p>

<p>“Was it William Penn that fought the
battle?” asked Mabel, with a desire to
appear interested.</p>

<p>“No-o,” returned Harold, in a tone of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
disgust; “of course, it was not. It was
General Washington. William Penn
didn’t fight. Why, don’t you know, he
was a Quaker? You remember how he
loved peace, and made the treaty with
the Indians.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I do remember now,” replied
Mabel. “I’m awfully stupid about
history. I never remember who did
things. Oh, Harold! see that old woman
limping along there; she looks like a
Quaker; but she is so wild and queer
looking. I believe she is crazy; I am
afraid of her.”</p>

<p>“Sho! There’s nothing the matter
with her; she is just looking for someone.
Hear her call: ‘Bobby, Bobby.’
Don’t you hear her?” In truth, the old
woman, hobbling along with a crutch,
did look somewhat distracted, for her cap
was awry, and her shawl dragged on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
ground. She paused, however, at sight
of the children.</p>

<p>“You didn’t see anything of a big grey
cat, with a collar on, as you come along,
did you?” she asked.</p>

<p>The children shook their heads.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear; I’m afraid he’s so scared
that he’ll never come back. I caught
sight of some boys setting their dog on
him two or three hours ago, and I’ve been
tramping about hunting for him ever
since. I’m nearly distracted, and I can’t
walk another step with my lame hip.”</p>

<p>The children looked at each other. If
they stopped now they would, maybe,
miss the sale; but Mabel spoke her
thought.</p>

<p>“I don’t care, I’m going to hunt up
that poor, frightened kitty. Which way
did he go?” She turned to the old
woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“Down the lane, in that direction.”</p>

<p>“We’ll look for him, and if we find
him, we’ll come back and tell you. I
don’t suppose we could catch him, for he
wouldn’t know us.”</p>

<p>“Thank thee, child. Thee is very
good to turn aside for an old woman,”
was the answer Mabel received.</p>

<p>Up and down the two children trudged;
the afternoon grew shorter and shorter,
and at last, up in a tree Mabel caught
sight of pussy, and back they went to
where the old woman still sat on her steps
waiting for them.</p>

<p>“We’ve found him!” cried Harold.
“He’s up a tree. Mabel saw him first.
Now, what shall we do to get him down?”</p>

<p>“Thee has brought good news, and
I’m very thankful,” said the old woman.
“He’s all I’ve got, and we’ve kept house
together for fifteen years. He’s old, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
a cat, but is still spry; he can’t bite
much, but he can scratch, and I’m afraid
he might be hurt somewhere, and couldn’t
get home, and would die off there alone.
Let me see, what is the best thing to be
done. I’m afraid my lameness will prevent
me from walking any further.”</p>

<p>“I can climb the tree,” said Harold,
“but how will I get him down?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get thee a net bag, and maybe
thee can manage to get him into that by
throwing it over him and drawing the
strings; then he’ll be safe enough, and
so will thee, too. Thee is sure thee is not
afraid?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try my best to get him,” said
Harold, sturdily. And off the children
started to find Bobby still up in the tree.</p>

<p>Harold began to climb toward him, but
the higher he went, the higher did pussy
go, till Mabel, in alarm, called: “You’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
fall, Harold; the branches are getting so
little. You’d better come down.” Harold,
sitting astride a limb, looked down at her.</p>

<p>“What’s up, sis?” said someone from
the road.</p>

<p>Mabel turned, and saw a man sitting
in a cart. “A cat,” she replied. The man
laughed, and climbed down from his seat.</p>

<p>“Your’n?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, an old lady’s up the street; and
we promised to try and get the cat down
for her. It was chased by some dogs and
boys.”</p>

<p>“Pretty high up, ain’t she?” returned
the man. “Your brother, there?”</p>

<p>“No; at least, he’s just like my
brother; he lives at our house.”</p>

<p>The man stood rubbing his chin, and
looking up in the tree.</p>

<p>“You had better come down, bub,” he
called to Harold. “That there cat’ll stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
up there as long as you do. I’ll find a way
to get her.” And Harold began, slowly, to
descend. “You just keep an eye on my
horse for a minute, and don’t let nobody
run off with him, and I’ll find a way to
get your cat,” said the man, smiling down
at Mabel.</p>

<p>He crossed the street, and entered a
small butcher shop, coming out presently
with a bit of meat in his hand, and a long
pole.</p>

<p>By this time, Harold had reached the
ground, and both children were calling,
coaxingly, “Pussy, pussy, pussy;” but
Bobby did not move. He was away out
on a slender limb, to which he clung
steadfastly.</p>

<p>“It’ll most take a hook and ladder
company to bring her down,” said the
man, “but I’ll try this before we call out
the force.” He tied the meat on the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of the pole, led his horse over so the cart
would stand under the tree; then he
climbed up on the seat, and, by so doing,
could just reach the limb with his pole.
Slowly he moved it along till it dangled
under the cat’s nose. This was too much
for Bobby, and he moved toward the tidbit,
which the man drew slowly along
till Bobby had reached the trunk of the
tree in trying to reach the meat. But
here he hesitated, and looked wildly
around, fearing to go further.</p>

<p>“Here, sis, come take the pole,” the
man called to Mabel, and she obeyed.</p>

<p>“You can rest it agen the tree,” he
said, “and just ease it down as the cat
follows. You and me has got to git out
of the way,” he said to Harold, “the
crittur’s used to petticoats, and ain’t
goin’ to trust herself among men and
boys.” He led his cart and horse away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
bidding Harold to follow, and the two
kept out of sight, till Bobby, seeing the
coast clear of all but one little girl, began
to descend. When he was safely
within catching distance the man rushed
from behind the tree where he had been
hiding, grabbed Bobby, and thrust him
into the bag which Harold held.</p>

<p>“There you are!” said the man. “No,
no! I don’t want no thanks; I ain’t had
such fun in a coon’s age. Here, take
along this piece of meat; he’d ought to
have it; ’taint right to tempt critturs
that way and then disappint ’em.” And,
giving them a good-natured nod as he
mounted his cart, he drove away.</p>

<p>“What an awfully good, kind man,”
exclaimed Mabel, watching him depart.
“I couldn’t have believed anyone so
rough, and in such coarse, dirty clothes
could be so nice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“He is a brick,” pronounced Harold.
“Come, Mabel, we must hurry; it’s getting
awfully late, and I expect we shall
miss the auction altogether.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care, as long as we saved the
kitty. Maybe the dogs would have
caught him, if he had tried to come down
when we were not there. Anyhow, the
old Quaker lady was awfully distressed
about him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and do you know, I believe those
fellows were just waiting around, for I
saw two or three peep out from the corner
of a house, and they were snickering and
whispering; I believe they were the very
ones.”</p>

<p>Although Bobby struggled and
squirmed, he could not escape from the
bag, and was safely brought home, Harold
not loosing his hold till he had landed
his charge within doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>They were greeted joyfully by the old
lady, who led them into a neat sitting
room. “Now, sit down here, my dears,” she
said. “My name is Deborah Knight,
and I want to give thee a taste of my old-fashioned
cinnamon-bun. I don’t think
there is any better made in Philadelphia
and I never ate it anywhere else. I am
going to take Bobby upstairs in my
room, and give him a saucer of milk; so,
wait here till I come back.”</p>

<p>Left to themselves, the children looked
around the room, which was cosy and
filled with old-fashioned furniture.
Mabel’s eyes wandered over the various
articles on the mantel, and the tables, but
Harold’s attention was attracted by an
old bookcase filled with books. He tip-toed
over to it, and began to read the
titles. “We might find the book here,”
said Harold; “See, there are some real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
old ones here, and this is an old house;
the furniture is, I know, and so are those
portraits in the queer frames.”</p>

<p>The two children knelt before the
shelves, and eagerly read each title as
best they could, but the book they so
desired was not among them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Knight entering the room, found
them thus occupied. “What do you find
there, children?” she asked. “Does
thee like books, Harold? I’ll show thee
one with some pretty pictures in it. But
here now, help thyself and thee too,
Mabel,” and she set a plate of toothsome
bun and two glasses of milk before them.
“Bobby’s all right,” she told them. “No
one knows how I felt about him. When
one doesn’t have anyone much but a cat
to care for, it becomes a matter of deep
concern if anything happens to him.
Some persons set store by old furniture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
and houses and books, but my cat is worth
more to me than all such things.”</p>

<p>“Mabel’s father just loves old books,”
Harold informed her, “and we’ve been
hunting for a very special one for him,
but we can’t find it; we’ve been to all the
old book-stores in the city.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, that is too bad,” returned Mrs.
Knight. “I wish I might be able to help
thee.” She considered the subject for a
moment and then went on: “I have a pile of
old books up in the garret, but I fear it would
not be much use to examine them. I was
intending to sell them to the junk man;
they are of no use to me, and I am getting
ready to go into the country, where
I can live secure from dogs and bad
boys.”</p>

<p>At the mention of the old books, Mabel
became too excited to help herself to the
tempting food before her, and began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
breathlessly: “Those books, I wonder if
you would let us see them before you do
the junk man. It is a very old book
that we have been hunting for, and you
know, it might happen to be among those
you have.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ll let thee see them, and
welcome,” returned Mrs. Knight; “it isn’t
quite dark yet, and the garret is a light
one for it faces the west and gets the last
rays of the sun. Eat thy bun, and then
I’ll let thee look at whatever I have.”</p>

<p>At this, the children hastily dispatched
their treat, declaring nothing ever could
be better, and then they followed Mrs.
Knight up the queer, narrow stairs which
led to the garret.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OVER by a little dormer window in
the garret, they found the pile of
books, and Mrs. Knight left them to
make their examination by the fast waning
light of the afternoon.</p>

<p>One by one, Mabel and Harold laid
the books aside, after peeping inside
the covers. They divided the lot, and
each took a certain number to examine.</p>

<p>Mabel was about half way down the
heap upon which she was at work, when,
suddenly, she gave a little cry of joy:
“Oh, Harold; here it is! It is, it is!
Look; do look!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_074">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="O, HAROLD, HERE IT IS!">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“O, HAROLD, HERE IT IS!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Harold dropped the musty volume he
had just picked up, and came over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
where Mabel was, hardly willing to believe
that she was right in making such
an announcement.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be switched if it isn’t!”
he said, after looking it over carefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, do let us hurry down with it to
Mrs. Knight! Oh, Harold, do you suppose
she will sell it to me?” Mabel said,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course, I think she will,” Harold
answered from the stairs, down which
he was going post-haste.</p>

<p>Mabel followed, holding tightly to the
book, and they quite startled not only the
old lady, but her cat, who was sitting in
her lap.</p>

<p>Bobby fled under the sofa, with tail
twice its usual size, as the children burst
into the room, crying: “We’ve found it,
we’ve found it!”</p>

<p>“Softly, my dears; softly. You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
scared poor Bobby, who is so nervous
after his late troubles; I think he is
afraid his enemies are upon him again.”</p>

<p>“Poor Bobby,” said Mabel, gently,
pausing in the centre of the room. “We
wouldn’t hurt you for the world. See,
Mrs. Knight; we did find the book.
Will you sell it to me; I have five dollars
to buy it with?”</p>

<p>“Five dollars? The whole lot wouldn’t
bring that!” exclaimed Mrs. Knight.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it would,” returned Mabel,
honestly; “for one of those books sold a
day or two ago for fifteen.”</p>

<p>“Does thee really mean it? Well, my
cat is worth more than that to me; so,
take the book, and be welcome to it.”</p>

<p>Mabel could hardly believe her ears.
“Oh,” she exclaimed; “do you really
mean to give it to me?”</p>

<p>“I would scarce tell thee to take it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
unless I meant it; and, in my opinion, it
is very little to give. I cannot see why
thee should consider it of any value.”</p>

<p>“But,” went on honest Mabel, “we
know it is worth a great deal, for the
man who bought the one we saw, said he
wouldn’t take fifty dollars for it.”</p>

<p>“And I would not take a hundred dollars
for my cat. Besides, I am an old
woman, with neither kit nor kin, and
when I die, what I have will go to charity;
so, if the book is of any use to thee, take
it, child; it is a very small thing to me
in return for what thee has done.”</p>

<p>Mabel’s radiant face expressed her
thanks, without her words. “Now, we
must go,” she said, after she had repeated
her words of appreciation, again and again.
“Oh, see how dark it is getting. Mamma
will be dreadfully worried, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll not keep thee a moment,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Mrs. Knight said. “Come again, if thee
cares to visit an old, lame woman and
her cat. I shall be glad to see you both
at any time, and if there is anything I
can do for either of you, it will give me
pleasure to do it.”</p>

<p>They promised to come again, and
made their farewells, then set out for the
cars.</p>

<p>“Just think,” said Mabel, as they
turned the corner, “if we hadn’t stopped
to help Mrs. Knight to find her cat, we
might never have been able to get the
book.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they call ‘bread upon the
waters,’” returned Harold, sagely.</p>

<p>Mabel was a little puzzled, until Harold
explained what it meant.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose it is about the same as
‘one good turn deserves another,’” she
decided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Dear me, how long the cars are coming,”
said Harold. “Your mamma will
think we are lost, and won’t believe I am
taking very good care of you.”</p>

<p>They reached home at last, but not
before Mrs. Ford had, indeed, begun to
feel much worried at their long absence.
But she did not scold, after she had heard
their joyous voices at her door, and learned
what had detained them.</p>

<p>Mabel concluded her story with: “So,
you see, we couldn’t help it. Was it very
wrong to stay, mamma?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; although it has given
me an anxious hour. Still, it is worth
that much to see my little girl relieved
of her anxiety, and to know that she
has well earned her right to be trusted
again. And also, that she has proven,
beyond question, that she is honest and
faithful. Papa will be so very glad, dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“May I go to him right away? Is he
in the library?” Mabel asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is there; and you may go
right away.”</p>

<p>Mabel turned, a little doubtfully, to
where Harold had stood a moment before;
but he had taken in the situation, and
had left the room. “Oh, Harold isn’t
here,” said the little girl. “Mamma,
ought I to ask him to go with me to
papa?”</p>

<p>“You would rather not?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I ought to, when he
helped me so much about getting the
book?”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily; and I think he has
gone off on purpose, for I am sure he
understands how you feel. If he comes
back, I’ll tell him that you intended to
ask him. Now, run along, dearie.”</p>

<p>It had been many weeks since Mabel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
had crossed the threshold of the library,
and her father looked up in surprise, as
he saw her at the door.</p>

<p>“Mamma said I might come,” she
began eagerly, “and oh, papa, I have the
book; here it is.”</p>

<p>“The book? What book?” He took
the package mechanically, while Mabel
stood on tip-toe with her hands tightly
clasped, and her eyes fixed on his face.</p>

<p>As Mr. Ford’s gaze rested on the old
book with its dull covers, his surprise was
evident. “Why, Mabel,” he exclaimed,
“where did you get this? It is even an
older edition than mine, and in quite as
good, if not better condition than mine
was originally. Tell me about it, little
daughter.” And he drew her kindly to
his knee.</p>

<p>Then Mabel poured forth her tale,
beginning with her resolve to make good,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
if possible, the mischief she had done.
“For you know, papa,” she concluded by
saying, “you always have told me that
one ought never to be in debt, and so— Are
you pleased, papa? Do you trust
me again?”</p>

<p>He kissed her and drew her closer.
“Indeed I do, dear child,” he answered.</p>

<p>“And I may come into the library
again?”</p>

<p>“Just as before.”</p>

<p>Mabel gave a little satisfied sigh. It
was so good to have all restrictions taken
away.</p>

<p>“Now I must go to work again,
daughter,” said her father. “Thank you
very much for getting me the book; and,
yes, I think I shall have to give you the
other one. Keep it on your shelves, and
perhaps it will remind you of two or
three things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“What?”</p>

<p>“Can you guess?”</p>

<p>“One is, not to meddle with what isn’t
mine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is one.”</p>

<p>“And the other—I can’t guess,
papa.”</p>

<p>“That ‘a wrong confessed is half redressed’,
and that your father has very
great respect for the honor and justice,
and self-sacrifice his little daughter has
shown.”</p>

<p>Then Mabel left him, and trudged upstairs
feeling very happy. On her way
down again her mother met her. “Mrs.
Lewis was here this afternoon,” she said,
“and she said we must all come to the
lawn party. She told me there seemed
to be some coolness between Marie and
you, but she hoped that nothing serious
was the matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Oh, mamma, do you think Marie has
said anything about me to her mother?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but if she has, Mrs. Lewis
does not seem to attach much importance
to it. If mammas were to take seriously
all the little fusses their children get into,
I am afraid they would have a hard time
of it.”</p>

<p>Mabel stood patting the baluster softly.
She was thinking very soberly. Presently
she looked up, “Mamma, do you
mind if I give the five dollars to the
Cuban orphans?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I have not the slightest objection.”</p>

<p>“Won’t the girls be surprised?”</p>

<p>“Do you want them to be?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I think so. They were
very mean to me, to be sure, and we have
scarcely spoken for weeks. Would you
go to the lawn party if you were I,
mamma? I don’t think you know how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
hateful they were,” and then she told her
story.</p>

<p>“They were very unjust, I admit,”
her mother told her, “but I think they
will be very much ashamed of themselves
when they see you willing to help them
so generously. Yes, I think you and
Alice and Harold should all go, even if
the girls have been unkind. It will not
be a social affair, remember, and if the
cause is good the rest does not matter.”</p>

<p>“But about the money, mamma; I
was going to ask you to send it for
me.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you rather spend it at the
lawn party? You might give a part of it
to the fund, but you’ll be doing just the
same if you buy things from the girls,
and, besides, it will be pleasant for them
to feel that they have such a good customer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
What was the reason you thought
you would not spend it there?”</p>

<p>“Because—because—I didn’t want to
show off,” Mabel answered, shyly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford put her arm around the
child. “I think you have already sacrificed
enough, dear,” she said. “No one
doubts that you have the right feeling.
Never mind what the girls think, but go
and enjoy yourself. I promised Mrs.
Lewis that I would send a contribution
of biscuits and salad, and several of the
neighbors have promised me something.
So I shall probably send you and Harold
off foraging to-morrow; at least, I’ll
let you collect some of the articles for
me.”</p>

<p>“Mamma, Mrs. Knight has such beautiful
flowers; I wonder if she wouldn’t
give us some? She said she would
be glad to do anything she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
for us, because we helped her to get
Bobby.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford considered for a moment.
“If you want to go and ask her, I see no
harm in it, but you’d better wait till Friday
morning, so the flowers will be
fresh, if you get any.”</p>

<p>Therefore, Mrs. Knight received a
second visit from the children, as she was
busy making some of her famous cinnamon-bun,
on Friday morning. Mabel
explained their errand and met with a
hearty response.</p>

<p>“Give you some flowers? To be sure, I
will, gladly; and you can have every one
in the garden, if you want them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we couldn’t carry every one,” said
Harold, in all seriousness. Mrs. Knight
laughed. “Thee is literal enough for a
Friend,” she said. “Then I will not give
thee all my flowers, but how would thee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
like a loaf of my bun? I’ll warrant they’ll
not have any like it at thy friend’s party,
Mabel. But I give it to thee, and thee
must donate it in thy name.”</p>

<p>“Oh, would that be fair?” asked the
little girl.</p>

<p>“Does thee think a Friend would tell
thee to do a thing unfair? Then if thy
compunctions are even more tender than
mine I will give it to thee to do with as
thee chooses.”</p>

<p>“But, can you spare it, Mrs. Knight?”</p>

<p>“I can make more when I want it,”
she returned. “I always keep it on
hand, for I am fond of it myself, thee
sees.”</p>

<p>Therefore, with their hands and arms
laden, they returned to the city, and the
exclamations of appreciation which met
them when their donations were handed
in, warmed their hearts mightily, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
made Mabel, at least, feel much more
that she was a welcome guest.</p>

<p>Still, Marie and Ethel had not yet
greeted her, and she rather anxiously
waited to find out how they would act
when they saw her there.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MARIE LEWIS’ pretty home in West
Philadelphia looked very bright
and attractive on the afternoon of the
lawn party. Mabel and Harold stood
looking around at the tables and booths.</p>

<p>“That’s the tea-house,” said Mabel,
indicating a gay structure at one end of
the grounds. “Ethel is going to help
serve the tea, and her sister is the Rebecca
at the Well, where the lemonade is. I
think we’ll get some lemonade first
thing, for I am so thirsty.”</p>

<p>They sauntered over to the well, passing
the tea pagoda on their way. Just
here Mrs. Lewis stopped them. She had
in her hands a plate of Mrs. Knight’s
cinnamon-bun. “Come right in here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Mabel,” she said. “I’m taking this to the
tea-house; it will be so nice to serve with
the tea. Have you seen Marie? Here
is Ethel, too.”</p>

<p>The girls looked at each other rather
sheepishly as they saw Mabel. Mrs.
Lewis went on: “Just think, girls, how
Mabel has worked for us. She brought
those lovely flowers over on the middle
table, and besides those and this delicious
bun, she has given three dollars, all herself,
to the fund.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Marie blushed up to the roots
of her hair, and looked at Ethel. Mrs.
Lewis passed on, leaving the four children
standing there, rather embarrassed at
the situation.</p>

<p>Harold broke the silence by saying,
with a little amused smile: “Come on,
Mabel, we were going to get some lemonade,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Oh,” Ethel started forward, “don’t
go away yet. I—we—you know we
didn’t know.”</p>

<p>“But we were horrid,” Marie broke in,
“and I’m awfully ashamed of myself,
really I am, Mabel, and I think it was
sweet of you to come this afternoon,
after the way we behaved. Don’t you,
Ethel?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” replied Ethel, a little
awkwardly. It was harder for her to
yield than for Marie. “But why didn’t
you say, in the first place, that you were
going to give such a lot?” she asked,
turning to Mabel. “You didn’t say
you’d save up and give more than any
of us.”</p>

<p>Mabel looked down. She couldn’t
explain.</p>

<p>But Harold was equal to the occasion.
“Because she thought she had a debt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
pay; to make good something that was
spoiled, and until she knew about that
she thought she oughtn’t to call the
money hers, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think that was right,” Marie
exclaimed. She gave Mabel a little
squeeze. “I’m so glad,” she said in a
low tone. “You’re a dear, just a dear,
Mabel, and I’ll never get mad with you
and treat you so again. Truly, I wanted
to be friends. I have missed you so
much, all this time.”</p>

<p>It was not so easy for Ethel to give in,
but, finally, she, too, showed her good
will by opening a box of caramels she
was carrying. She offered them to Mabel
and Harold. “I know they are good,”
she said, “for my aunt made them. Take
a whole lot, Mabel.” And she gave her
a generous supply.</p>

<p>However, glad as Mabel was that all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
was smooth sailing again, she did not
feel quite happy with the girls, and so
she and Harold wandered off to seek out
their own amusements. After they had
eaten all the ice-cream and cake of which
they were capable, and had bought more
candy and had had more lemonade
than was good for them, they found a
little corner on one of the piazzas, and
here they decided to settle down, for
awhile, and watch the people, who were
now beginning to gather rapidly.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully tired,” said Mabel. “I
just feel as if my feet didn’t belong to
me. Harold, I was just thinking that
your papa will perhaps know some of the
Cuban orphans, if any of his friends get
killed.”</p>

<p>Harold’s face took on a serious look
as it always did when his father was
mentioned. “I wish I knew about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
father,” he said, after a pause, “I haven’t
heard for two weeks, and neither has
Drake.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Mabel wished that she had not
said anything about Captain Evans’
friends and their orphans.</p>

<p>“You see,” Harold went on, “the last
time we did hear he was still at camp,
but he expected to be ordered to Cuba at
any time, and I suppose he may be on
his way there. Of course, I want him to
be as brave as the others, but I get scared
sometimes, for fear he will be killed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then would you be a Cuban
orphan?” Mabel asked, in an awe-stricken
tone.</p>

<p>“Why, not exactly. I don’t know
whether it means those who fight in
Cuba, or those who are Cuban people; it
might be either way. Don’t let’s talk
about it any more. Aren’t there a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
people here now? It’s not been so crowded
since we came.”</p>

<p>Just then two gentlemen sauntered up
and stood looking at the gay scene before
them. One was Marie’s father, Mabel
knew.</p>

<p>“There’s not much chance of our having
an occasion like this another year,”
Mr. Lewis remarked: “The war won’t
last long.”</p>

<p>Mabel nudged her companion, and they
listened with all their ears.</p>

<p>“Too bad, though, the way our fellows
have had to be sacrificed at camp,”
returned Mr. Lewis’ friend. “Every
day I hear of someone from here having
succumbed to typhoid fever, and the
warm weather will not improve the conditions,
I am afraid. By the way, you
knew Captain Evans. I learned at the
club on my way uptown, that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
gone. Poor fellow, as nice a man as I
ever knew. Died of typhoid fever.”</p>

<p>Harold clutched Mabel’s arm and
turned very pale. “Did you hear?” he
whispered.</p>

<p>Mabel nodded; she understood. “Perhaps
there is some mistake,” she whispered,
in return. “Wait, I want to ask
something.”</p>

<p>She went up to Mr. Lewis, who looked
down at her kindly. “If you please, Mr.
Lewis,” she said, “That Captain Evans
you know, that you were just talking
about, did he have any little boy?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis glanced inquiringly at his
friend, who nodded. “Yes, I think so,”
he made answer.</p>

<p>“And is his name Harold?” Mabel’s
eyes were getting very moist, and she
gave a quick little gasp.</p>

<p>The gentleman seemed to be trying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
remember. “Why, let me see; yes, I
am pretty sure he has. I think I’ve heard
him call his boy Harry. Yes, that’s it;
Harry.”</p>

<p>Mabel glanced around, but only caught
sight of Harold’s retreating figure. She
ran quickly after him; and, taking hold
of his hand, she held it tightly. “We’ll
go home and tell mamma,” she whispered.</p>

<p>Harold bit his lip, and tried to keep
back the tears, but hurried on.</p>

<p>They were not long in reaching home,
and then Harold broke away from Mabel,
and she saw him disappear into his
room.</p>

<p>Her sympathetic little heart was too
full for speech as she burst into Mrs.
Ford’s room and buried her face in her
mother’s lap.</p>

<p>“Why, my little girl,” exclaimed Mrs.
Ford; “did the girls treat you badly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
after all? I am so sorry; I hoped it
would be all right, and that you would
have no more trouble.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t the girls,” Mabel sobbed;
“they were lovely; it’s Harold.”</p>

<p>“Why, dear me, how has he hurt your
feelings; you have been getting along so
beautifully together? What has he
done?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t done anything,” Mabel
said, between her sobs; “it’s his father.”</p>

<p>“His father! Has he come back?”</p>

<p>No answer, but a shake of the brown
locks.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see; he has sent for Harold.
Well, dear; we knew that would have to
be sometime. Don’t cry about it; but
try to make Harold happy while he is
here.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that,” Mabel found voice to
say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“Then, what is it—what has his father
done?”</p>

<p>“He’s died, and Harold is a Cuban
orphan,” Mabel replied, with a fresh
burst of tears.</p>

<p>“My dear, are you sure? Come, tell
me about it; I don’t understand. We
have not heard a word of it. Look up
and tell me, child.”</p>

<p>Mabel managed to convey her news,
though in a somewhat disjointed manner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford looked grave, and went to
Harold’s door; but, receiving no answer to
her gentle knock, she went in, and saw that
the little fellow had flung himself across
the bed, and was crying convulsively.
He raised his head as Mrs. Ford entered,
and came to the arms she held out to
him.</p>

<p>She gathered him closely to her. “Don’t
give up hope, dear child,” she said. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
think there may be a mistake; and, under
any circumstances, you know we love
you, and are glad to keep you with us.”</p>

<p>Mabel had crept in softly. “Oh,
mamma, always?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do say always,” she begged;
“and let Harold be my brother; then
I’ll not be the middle one any more, and
I’ll try—oh, Harold! I will try to be as
much like a boy as I can, and as mamma
will let me. I’ll play anything you like
to have me. I’ll climb trees and all;
and I’ll even try not to be afraid of
cows.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford could but smile; but she
added more comforting words till Harold
at last lifted his head and said: “Where
is Don? I want Don.” And Mabel, delighted
to be able to do something, flew
to bring the dear dog, and with Don<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
hugged up close to him Harold, after a
while, fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was warm, mild May weather, and
Mabel, too excited to sleep, crept to the
window to watch for her father that night,
for she felt that he would, perhaps, be
able to decide upon the truth of the report
they had heard, and besides, her mother
had said, that if it were not too late, he
would go down to the club, and gather
particulars. But it was very late; a meeting
of some kind had kept him at the
university, and Mabel grew very weary,
before she saw his familiar form coming
in at the gate.</p>

<p>She crept softly down stairs, and
entered her mother’s room in time to hear
Mr. Ford say, as he looked at his watch:
“I am afraid it is too late to-night to do
anything, but I will inquire into the
matter the very first thing in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
morning. Poor little fellow. I hope he
will sleep soundly. His father was all in
all to him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say was,” said Mrs. Ford, “for I
do not quite believe the report.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ford shook his head. “I wouldn’t
be too sanguine,” he returned. “You
say Harold told you his father generally
called him Harry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the part which makes it
seem as if there were no mistake.”</p>

<p>“And can’t Harold stay here always?”
Mabel asked, as her father lifted her to
his knee.</p>

<p>“That will be as his aunt says. We
have no right to decide upon that. You
will still have to be our boy, I think,” he
said, smiling, for it had always been a
joke between Mabel and her father, that
of her being the boy of the family, and
Mabel liked to be called “Phil,” for she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
always insisted that she ought to have
had her father’s name.</p>

<p>“But what are you doing up this time
of night?” Mr. Ford asked. “You should
have been in bed and asleep hours ago.”</p>

<p>Mabel gave him a mighty hug, and
crept upstairs again, feeling very sorry
for Harold, and wishing that she could
do something to comfort him.</p>

<p>The re-instatement in the favor of her
friends seemed a small thing, compared
to this last matter of interest, and after
she had cuddled down again by the side
of her sister Alice, she got up and went
to the door leading to Harold’s room, to
whisper to him, through the key hole,
“Good-night, Harold, I hope you will
sleep well, and I’ll stay awake all night
if you think you will feel lonely.”</p>

<p>But Harold did not hear her, for he
had cried himself to sleep long before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
and, though Mabel’s promise to stay
awake was made in all good faith, it was
not ten minutes later that she was soundly
sleeping too, little dreaming that she
would be the first one to bring comfort to
the boy’s sorrowful heart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WORN out with his grief, Harold slept
rather late the next morning, and
Mrs. Ford would not have him disturbed.
Since it was Saturday, Mabel did not
have to go to school, and she amused herself
as best she could in the garden. She
wished that Harold would come down,
but she concluded that, until he did, she
would occupy herself by playing marbles.
The fact that they hurt her knuckles
did not deter her from making up her
mind to keep on till she could do as well
as Harold.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“SHE OCCUPIED HERSELF WITH TRYING TO PLAY MARBLES.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>She was so absorbed in this employment
that she did not hear the gate open,
nor see who had entered, till she heard
someone close beside her, say: “That’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
pretty good shot for a little girl,” and
looking up, she saw a gentleman whose
face looked rather familiar.</p>

<p>She jumped to her feet and stood gazing
at him, her recollection who it was
gradually returning, and then she cried
out: “Why, you weren’t alive yesterday.”</p>

<p>Captain Evans, for it was he, threw
back his head and laughed heartily in
such a very alive way that Mabel could
not doubt for a moment that he was flesh
and blood. “I feel very much alive
to-day,” he assured her. “Are you Miss
Ford?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” Mabel returned, “I’m only the
middle one, and I’ll not be anything else,
till Alice is married.”</p>

<p>Captain Evans laughed again. Mabel
thought he seemed a very jolly person.</p>

<p>“You’re really Harold’s father,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
said. “Oh, do hurry in and see him, for
he thought he didn’t have a father any
more, and he was so miserable.”</p>

<p>Captain Evans instantly became grave.</p>

<p>“Did he really believe that? My poor
little boy,” and he hurried up the walk.</p>

<p>Mabel, flying ahead of him, ran up the
steps crying joyfully, “Harold! Harold!
Quick!” And she almost fell over him
as he appeared at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>“He is alive! He is! He is!” she
cried. “Come down.”</p>

<p>But Harold needed no second bidding,
for he had caught sight of a beloved
figure already mounting the stairs, and,
with one shout of joy, he threw himself
into his father’s arms, and was fairly
lifted off his feet in the energy of the
greeting that his father gave him.</p>

<p>It was all easily enough explained,
when one realizes that Evans is not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
very uncommon name, and had there
been time to make a few more inquiries,
the fact would have been brought to light
that the Captain Evans who died at camp
was another man, whose son Harry was a
a boy of fifteen, with several sisters and
brothers.</p>

<p>Harold and Mabel felt very sorry for
these other Evanses, even while they
were so happy over the turn affairs had
taken.</p>

<p>“Your aunt is still in no state of health
to take charge of a restless little boy,”
Captain Evans told his son, “and so I
thought I must get leave to come on for a
few days, and look after my son, for we
have imposed long enough upon the
kindness of these good friends.”</p>

<p>Harold’s face fell. “And where am I
going?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know just yet, but I am corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
with someone in the country,
and I hope to make arrangements to send
you to a farm for the summer. You
would like that, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Harold, “if Mabel
could go, too.”</p>

<p>Mabel, listening, took hold of Captain
Evans’ fingers and looked into his face
earnestly. “Would it be very far away?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“No, only up here in Pennsylvania, a
little way.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you please to tell mamma
about it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, I shall be glad to,” returned
the captain.</p>

<p>And the outcome was that, not only
was the farm found to be the place for
Harold, but for the Ford family, too;
with the exception of Mr. Ford, who was
going abroad for the summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“It is just the spot for us,” Mrs. Ford
declared; “a place where I can turn the
children loose, and know that they are
safe.”</p>

<p>Mabel turned a beaming face toward
Harold. “Do you hear that?” she exclaimed.
“We’ll be turned loose, and I
can go fishing, and I can climb trees and
fences, and play all sorts of boy plays,
without having the girls think I am a
tom-boy. Oh, won’t it be fun? And we
will be together all summer, and in the
fall—” she looked at Captain Evans.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too far to think about
now,” he answered, “but if the war is
over, and if I am spared, I shall be able
to make my plans more readily than I
can now.”</p>

<p>“I hope the people will be nice and
kind on the farm and will let me have
Don,” said Harold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“That is the only difficulty,” his father
told him. “I’m afraid you cannot take
Don with you, but Drake has promised
to take charge of him, and if all goes
well you can have him again when you
get back. It is too bad, I know,” he continued,
seeing how disappointed Harold
looked, “but you would have had to leave
him anyhow, if you had gone to your
aunt’s, for she would not have received
the dog, I know.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t I take Don to the farm?”
inquired Harold, still hoping for consent.</p>

<p>“Because Mrs. Knight doesn’t allow
dogs on the place. She has a favorite
cat, and, at first, was hardly willing to
take a boy. For some reason she doesn’t
approve of boys or dogs, but Mrs. Ford
seems to have overcome her objections.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Knight!” Mabel exclaimed.
“Oh, mamma, is it our Mrs. Knight?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Deborah Knight? She was going to
move into the country; I remember.
Has she gone? Is it to her house we are
going? I do hope it is.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is your Deborah Knight,” her
mother told her. “I was going to keep
it as a little surprise for you, but it
doesn’t matter. As soon as she is settled
on her farm, she is to let us know. When
I saw her, and told her who I was, she
immediately remembered you and Harold,
and consented at once to take us all
into her home. She has a large house,
and thinks she will be rather lonely
there, and seemed really pleased at the
idea of having ‘those two kind and tender
children,’ as she calls you.”</p>

<p>“Is she going to be a farmer herself?
How can she, when she is lame?” Mabel
asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford smiled. “No, she has a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
and his wife who attend to the farm for
her. They live in a little house on the
place. Mrs. Knight has changed a good
many of her plans in order to accommodate
us, and I hope you children will give
her no trouble.”</p>

<p>Of course the children protested that
they would not; and, indeed, they were
quite as reasonably good as one could
expect, and if they did, once in a while,
get into mischief, Mrs. Knight excused
it because of the unfailing respect they
showed to Bobby. This important member
of the household seemed to enjoy
country life after he had once become
used to the change of residence, and
rested secure from his natural enemies—boys
and dogs.</p>

<p>Like the grasshopper, the children
played through the summer days. The
fact that Marie Lewis had gone to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
White Mountains, and Ethel Morris was
at Bar Harbor, did not, in the least, matter
to Mabel, who would not have exchanged
Mrs. Knight’s grove and garden
and barn for all the watering places in
the world, and who wanted no better companion
than Harold.</p>

<p>In the midst of summer came the news
of peace, and, later on, all Mrs. Knight’s
guests went back to town to see the
parades during the week of the Peace Jubilee
celebration. But this did not take
place before Mabel and Harold had a
little jubilee of their own, consequent
upon the news that Captain Evans, at
Mrs. Ford’s request, would allow Harold
to remain with the Fords for a year, at
least, and longer if his father were still
on active duty.</p>

<p>And, will you believe it? Harold,
dressed in uniform, marched with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
father’s regiment the day of the military
procession. To be sure, he did not go
all the way, but Mabel, up on one of the
stands, felt her heart swell with pride as
the regiment swung around the corner of
the Public Buildings, and she saw her
little companion bravely trying to keep
step with the soldiers. And when
the crowd cheered and cheered, she
thought it must be all for Harold, and
she stood up and waved her handkerchief
till her arm was tired.</p>

<p>Harold saw her, and, after the troops
had passed in review, his father sent him
to join his friends, and there they sat
and looked at the brave array of infantry,
cavalry, artillery and marines.</p>

<p>“When I am grown, I am going to be
a soldier,” Harold declared, all enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Mabel looked sober. That was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
a girl couldn’t be, although she
thought it would be fine to march by
Harold’s side in such a grand procession.</p>

<p>But that evening, when the Captain
told stories of suffering and distress, or
long marches and weary tramps through
rain and sleet, or under a scorching sun,
or the horrors of a battle, Mabel concluded
that, after all, it was rather comforting
to know that such things could
not be expected to come into her life, and
she felt very sorry for Harold, who, however,
grew only more excited as the
dangers were made more plain.</p>

<p>“But the only heroes are not the men
like Dewey and Hobson, and Schley and
Sampson,” Captain Evans said, at last.
“I’ve seen the greatest courage, though
of another kind, exhibited in quiet homes
and by those of whom the world never
hears. A small duty, which has no blare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
of trumpets nor roll of drums to encourage
one on to perform, sometimes requires
more real heroism than a charge in
battle.”</p>

<p>Mabel knew that. She knew that
everybody must fight something, and that
she, too, could be a soldier, in a quiet
way. That to become weary and to deny
oneself, to face danger and temptation,
was what was expected of those who had
enlisted under the banner of the great
Captain.</p>

<p>So, she nodded her head gravely, and
said, “Yes, I know.”</p>

<p>Harold’s face showed his appreciation,
and as if with one voice they broke out
into the martial hymn: “Onward, Christian
Soldiers.”</p>

<p>They sang it all through, and then
quiet fell upon the group. From a distance
came the roll of drums. A returning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
regiment going to its armory. Then
all was still again, except for the voice of
a cheery little cricket shrilling out its
peaceful song in some quiet corner of
the garden. Mabel snuggled up close
to her mother. Don rested his head lovingly
on his little master’s knee. Content
filled the hearts of all, for this evening.
The morrow would see Mabel at
school, to battle with more than books;
would see Harold, too, fighting his way
through his first Latin lessons.</p>

<p>The year had taught them many
things, but most of all, it had taught
them the value of truth and honor and
loving forbearance.</p>
